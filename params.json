It is available for installation via devtools and install_github at bjcochrane/TeachingPopGen\r\n\r\n## Population Genetics with R\r\n\r\nThis is a text that I've developed over the past several years.  It was written in RStudio and is constantly being upgraded.\r\n\r\n## Genetics 9e\r\n\r\nThis is a more proprietary project - a textbook revision - so not much, other than some occasional exploratory material, will show up here.\r\n",
